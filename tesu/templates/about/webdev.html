            <h1>About Web Development</h1>
            <p class=indented>I've been a web developer for most of life. <a href="http://boboclub.webs.com">This</a> is my first website&mdash;it's pretty funny to see what I thought was sensible web design in 2009. I like to think that I've improved since then.
            <p class=indented>I'm not sure why I felt like I needed a web presence as a third grader, but I was very passionate about it at the time. Afterwards, I got really excited about forum administration, and ran <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110606185513/http://epicpwnage.co.cc/forums/">my own instance</a> of Simple Machines Forum software. These sites I ran in middle school are unfortunately no longer accessible, since I ran them on crappy free web hosts such as 000webhost and x10Hosting. Kind of a shame too, as I had quite a few PHP web applications uploaded on these sites.
            <p class=indented>Later on, I decided to swear off using PHP for my tiny web applications and switch to making them standalone JavaScript applications. You can find some of them <a href="/misc">here</a>. However, I didn't completely stop using PHP on my personal site until <a href="/blog/yet-another-site-redesign">November 2017</a>. This change took so long because I was too reliant on my custom templating system written in PHP, which had always been the core of the site.
            <p class=indented>I used Ruby on Rails during an internship in high school. However, using a fully fledged MVC framework like Rails or Django for this site would have been overkill, so I opted to use Flask instead.
