            <h1>About Web Development</h1>
            <p class=indented>I've been a web developer for half of my life. <a href="http://boboclub.webs.com">This</a> is my first website&mdash;it's pretty funny to see what I thought was sensible web design in 2009. I'd like to think that I've improved over the past decade.
            <p class=indented>I'm actually not too sure why I felt like I needed a web presence when I was a third grader, but I defintely was passionate about wanting a website. I later got really invested into forum administration, and ran my own instance of Simple Machines Forum software. These sites I made in middle school are unfortunately lost forever since I ran them on crappy free web hosts such as 000webhost and x10Hosting. Kind of a shame too, as I had quite a few PHP web applications uploaded on these sites.
            <p class=indented>Later on, I decided to swear off using PHP for my tiny web applications and switch to making them standalone JavaScript applications. You can find some of them <a href="/misc">here</a>. However, I didn't completely stop using PHP on my personal site until <a href="/blog/yet-another-site-redesign">November 2017</a> because I was relying on it for my custom-written templating system, which had always been the core of the site. I changed around the site CSS, at one point adding in Material Design Lite. I also heavily modified the content, first by replacing the WordPress blog with a Google+ stream embed and later by reverting said change and making a new blog. But this really wasn't sustainable; the site grew slow for reasons still unknown for me, and I figured it was time for a complete rehaul from PHP to Python.
