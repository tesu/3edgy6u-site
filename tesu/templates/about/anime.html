            <p class=indented>I don't watch anime anymore. Last time I watched seasonal anime was in 2017, and the few shows I watched in 2018 weren't particularly enjoyable either, so I just stopped.
            <p class=indented>My favorite anime studio is (was?) Studio Trigger. I'm a big fan of all of their shows besides Kiznaiver and Darling in the Franxx. I also love Type-Moon, but I really wish they'd stop milking the Fate/Grand Order cash cow.
            <p class=indented>I had a brief stint with fansubbing in 2017, working as an editor for Chihiro-Fansubs. However, I couldn't stay motivated since there were so many delays, so I quit after two seasons. Fansubbing is dead.
            <p class=indented>I've attended a couple of anime conventions (Otakon, Katsucon, Anime Boston, Anime Central, Anime NYC) but I'm not much of a fan. I don't care about cosplayers and all fan panels I've attended sucked. All I really end up doing is purchasing merch that I could get cheaper online. I do enjoy their arcade sections (that are usually rented from Tokyo Attack); my go-to games include DDR/ITG, jubeat, and Dance Evolution.
