            <h1>About Anime</h1>
            <p class=indented>The first subbed anime I watched was Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica during the summer of 2013. However, I was no stranger to weeb culture back then, since I was already friends with many /a/ users on Google+.
            <p class=indented>My favorite anime studio is Studio Trigger. I'm a big fan of all of their shows besides Kiznaiver and Darling in the Franxx. I'm also a big Type-Moon fan, but I really wish they would focus on something new (Tsukihime remake?) instead of milking the Fate/Grand Order cash cow.
            <p class=indented>I had a brief stint with fansubbing working as an editor for Chihiro-Fansubs. However, I couldn't stay motivated since there were so many avoidable delays, so I quit after two seasons. Fansubbing is dead.
            <p class=indented>I've attended a couple of anime conventions (Otakon, Katsucon, Anime Boston, Anime Central, Anime NYC) but I've become quite jaded about them. I don't care too much about cosplaying and basically all fan panels I've seen are bad. All I really end up doing is purchasing weeb merch that I could get cheaper online. I do enjoy their arcade sections (that are usually rented from Tokyo Attack); my go-to games there include DDR/ITG, jubeat, and Dance Evolution.
