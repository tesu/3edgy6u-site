            <h1>About Programming</h1>
            <p class=indented>I wanted to make video games. That was my initial motivation for becoming a programmer, and even though my horizons have broadened a lot, game development is still very dear to me. That being said, the first lines of code I wrote were for web development; I taught myself JavaScript and PHP to further my web development goals.
            <p class=indented>Upon entering high school, I taught myself enough C++ to do competitive programming, while I learned Java and Android development in the classroom. I got a web development internship, where I learned Ruby on Rails, my first MVC framework. I then branched out and started working with Django.
            <p class=indented>Now that I'm in college, most of the code I write in class is in Python, but there's some Java too. I also have to begrudingly write C# for game development too. I'm be using OCaml during my Jane Street internship this summer.
