            <h1>About Gaming</h1>
            <p class=indented>I've always loved video games. Some of my fondest memories include playing classic games such as Pok√©mon Gold, A Link to the Past, and AdventureQuest. My family couldn't really afford getting new game consoles, so the only consoles I owned while growing up were a SNES, a PlayStation One, a Game Boy Color, and a Nintendo DS. Pok&eacute;mon was definitely my favorite game back then, but I don't care much for it anymore.
            <p class=indented>I created my Steam account in 2011 to get Portal for free, and I've been a PC gamer ever since. Those days, I played a lot of Spiral Knights and Team Fortress 2. I even spun up a couple of my own game servers and <a href="https://sourcemod.net/plugins.php?author=bobomaster&search=1">wrote some server plugins</a> for Team Fortress 2.
            <p class=indented>I've played a lot of MMOs, most of them being free-to-play. I'm not sure why I continue subjecting myself to the grind, but I do it anyway. Tera Online, Blade &amp; Soul, Dungeon Fighter Online, The Elder Scrolls Online, Star Wars: The Old Republic, Spiral Knights, Pok&eacute;MMO, Wakfu, Rusty Hearts... I've quit them all. I'm currently playing Final Fantasy XIV&mdash;who knows how long I'll stick with this one.
            <p class=indented>I also consider myself an avid Dota 2 player even though I'm really bad at the game. I also have the least total games played out of all the Dota players I know, so I guess that's one reason why. I attended The International in 2016 and 2017 and it was an unforgettable experience both times.
